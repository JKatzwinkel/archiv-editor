what is an interpretation?</h1>

      <div class="body">
        <p class="p" id="x38-7800011.2.3__idp218496">In order to verify the data entered into the Archiv-Editor, it is essential that
references are documented in detail. References, however, also need to be
systematically administrated to retain a clear overview. The data model for PDR
thus offers a system to administrate the references, which serves as the basis for
recording references in the Editor.
</p>

        <p class="p" id="x38-7800011.2.3__idp219320">Every aspect requires at least one cited reference, and the reference itself must be
considered valid.
                                                                     

                                                                     
</p>

        <p class="p" id="x38-7800011.2.3__idp220040">In addition, the text field (“internal”), allows the user to enter additional
information about a citation, for example, a page number within a book or the
position of a figure in a picture. This is advantageous, because a reference does
not necessarily have to be newly created, it can be created once and then cited
multiple times. This fits to the normal practice of academic referencing. It offers
however the benefit of being able to differentiate information according to its
reference.
</p>

        <p class="p" id="x38-7800011.2.3__idp221520">It is practical for a project to consider what kinds of references they will be using
and in what detail they will be documented. If, for example, an anthology will
be used, it could be useful to subdivide the different articles or essays,
which are probably written by different authors. This might however be
unnecessary if the anthology will not often be used or only one part of it.
Similarly, it could be helpful when working with Archivalia to document
single files and even to enter line numbers in the “internal” text field.
It should be remembered that all entries that belong to a reference are
systematically searchable, but not information recorded in the “internal” text
field.
</p>

        <p class="p" id="x38-7800011.2.3__idp223000">The internal attribute offers a text field for information about the citation that is
not covered in the general reference, and which gives more detail about the
location of the data, such as a page number. It is up to the project to determine
the advantages and disadvantages of either creating a more detailed general
reference or putting that information in the internal text field. It is usually
possible with a little consideration to recognize what is most practical for a
project’s workflow.
