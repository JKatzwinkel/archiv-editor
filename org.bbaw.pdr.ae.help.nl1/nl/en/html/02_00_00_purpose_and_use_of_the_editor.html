  <div class="body">
    <p class="p" id="x4-30002__idp748888">Exactly how biographical information is documented differs from project to
project. Generally, biographical information is classified through a standard
system: “name”, “birth”, “death”, or “profession” are examples of the most
common kinds of data recorded about persons. “place of study”, “spouse” or
“confession”, are less common, and “reason for exile”, “musical education”, or
“political affiliation” are seldom used. In order to retain this plurality, a data
model has been developed that assimilates multiple kinds of data while still
allowing comparisons between them. Similarly, the challenge of variant
names and dates has also been considered in the development of the data
model.The current data model comprehends a person, in their biographical sense, as a
summation of descriptions. One short description can already constitute a person;
a person who is not described, however, does not yet exist. If multiple
descriptions exist, each one contains a certain innate value, even when they
contradict one another.Thus the smallest unit of information which could be found in the data model
would be a single expression about a person. This kind of single expression will be
referred to as an “aspect”. The core of an aspect is a short descriptive text, such
as a sentence, phrase, or a single word. This descriptive text, also referred to in
the data model as a “notification”, is additionally marked up with semantic
tags. In the Archiv-Editor this markup is displayed with corresponding
colors.
