  <div class="body">
    <p class="p" id="x33-630009.5__idp984040">The concurrence perspective opens in the same way as the identifier perspective.
This perspective is also split into different sections, although this time four
instead of two. With the concurrence perspective it is possible to find persons
that are similar to another and then either mark them as concurrent or integrate
the data of one person into the other. This function helps to avoid the overlap or
doubling of data. For instance, two users could unknowingly enter the
same person in the Archiv-Editor, and this function allows these two
entries to be combined into one person. Or, it is possible that a person was
entered with very little data and is then later identified as a person already
existing in the Editor. This function exists to remove these kinds of double
entries.
</p>

    <p class="p" id="x33-630009.5__idp236016">As already mentioned, the concurrence perspective has four sections. The person
that has been selected from the tree and should be checked for double entries is
displayed in the lower left hand box with an aspect-view. In the box above, you
can search for persons that have overlapping characteristics. Checkmark the
desired search criteria, such as name or date of birth, and click search. A list will
appear with the overlapping persons (assuming that such persons exist). Double
click on a person in the list to open them up in the lower right hand box, also in
an aspect-view. The overlapping person’s information will also be displayed in the
upper right hand box.
</p>

    <p class="p" id="x33-630009.5__idp237704">It is now possible to compare the overlapping data of the two persons that are
display in the two lower (left and right) aspect-view boxes. If an actual
concurrence is found, then there are three options: (1) marking both persons as
concurrent (2) merging the data of the person on the right into the person on the
left (3) merging the data of the person on the left into that of the right. These
options are displayed on the three buttons which separate the upper and lower
section of the perspective. Merging data means that one person receives all the
aspects of the other and that the other person is deleted. If the persons should
not be integrated, but the concurrence should be recorded (option one), simply
click “Set Concurrence in both Persons”.   </p>
