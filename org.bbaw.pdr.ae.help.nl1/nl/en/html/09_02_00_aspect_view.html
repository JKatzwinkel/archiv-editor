  <h1 class="title topictitle1">Aspect-view</h1>

  <div class="body">
    <p class="p" id="x30-600009.2__idp236712">As the name already suggests, in the aspect-view the aspects of an object are
displayed. If, for example, a person is opened, then all the aspects of that person
are opened in the aspect-view. The aspects are separated into different tabs
according to their semantic classification and displayed within these tabs
chronologically.
</p>

    <p class="p" id="x30-600009.2__idp237512">To change this grouping, choose an option from the list “Group By”, found in the
upper left corner of the aspect-view. You can group aspects, for example,
by reference, year, or place. Press the button “Group” to see the new
results.
</p>

    <p class="p" id="x30-600009.2__idp238464">To adjust how the aspects are sorted within the different tabs, choose an option
under “Sort By”. After choosing how to sort the aspects (for example by, date,
last edited date, or creator) click on one of the two buttons directly to the right of
the “Sort By” list. The button “a-z” will display the aspects in ascending order
and (“z-a”) in descending order.
</p>

    <p class="p" id="x30-600009.2__idp239576">In the upper right corner of the aspect-view is a small text field next to a search
button (shown with a magnifying glass). By searching for one or more words and
clicking on the search button, only the aspects will be shown which contain
those words. Searching with an empty text field will result in a list of all
aspects.
</p>

    <p class="p" id="x30-600009.2__idp240376">Besides the search function there is another way to modify which aspects are
shown. In the upper right hand corner of the aspect-view is a row of small icons
and a white downward pointing arrow. These icons (the arrow opens up the full
list) offer different filter options. For instance, the Time Filter will only show
aspects from a certain time period. With the Reference Filter you can show
aspects from a certain reference. Clicking on a filter option usually opens up a
window where more exact information can be entered. For example, after clicking
on the Reference Filter a window containing a list of references will appear, in
which one or more references can be selected. More than one filter can be selected
through the list found under the white arrow. Filters selected are shown with a
black check mark. Clicking a second time on a checked filter deactivates
it.
</p>

    <p class="p" id="x30-600009.2__idp156648">Lastly, it should be noted that these functions of the aspect-view are also



available in the other perspectives (the identifier perspective and concurrence
perspective).
