        <p class="p" id="x38-7700011.2.2__idp212200">The data model was created, among other things, to be able to display
relationship-networks. The program offers multiple possibilities to document and
analyze relationships. The program differentiates between implicit and explicit
relationships.
</p>

        <p class="p" id="x38-7700011.2.2__idp212920">Implicit relationships appear on their own, from normal work with the Editor.
When information is recorded that includes their associations (as the
aspect-model allows), then connections are revealed. For instance, this occurs
when more than one person is documented as belonging to a club, or as
being students at the same time at the same university. Because these
relationships are not explicitly formulated, they are called “implicit”. If the focus
of a project is to discover the existence or potential existence of such
relationship-networks, then this project should mainly work with implicit
relationships.
</p>

        <p class="p" id="x38-7700011.2.2__idp214224">Explicit relationships are documented in the aspect model with their own data
field. This way, relationships between two or more persons can be described. The
syntax is based on a three tiered schema, “A is the X of B”. for example,
“Anton is the grandfather of Bertram” or “Sabine is the teacher of Tanja”.
Every project can create their own hierarchical vocabulary to classify
relationships. With the help of this common vocabulary, the relationships can be
systematically analysed. If the focus of a project is to analyze previously
documented relationship-networks, then the project should work with explicit
relationships.
</p>

        <p class="p" id="x38-7700011.2.2__idp216128">It is advisable to combine the findings of implicit and explicit relationships. This
could happen naturally from working with the Editor: implicit relationships can
later be formulated explicitly, when they have been fully established through the
research.
