        <p class="p" id="x23-450008.2.2__idp188528">Every user who has their own account can edit their
log-in data and additional personal information. Clicking
▹<em class="ph i">Preferences</em>▹<em class="ph i">Modify</em><em class="ph i">User Data </em>opens a mask which allows the user to edit information such as the
username, password or contact information.

        <p class="p" id="x23-450008.2.2__idp192408">Users who have the rights of an Admin can, at the following website:
</p>

        <p class="p" id="x23-450008.2.2__idp193312">
          <a class="xref" href="http://XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.XX" target="_blank">http://XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.XX</a>
        </p>

        <p class="p" id="x23-450008.2.2__idp194824">edit all the user data of the project. This means that they can enter new data and
edit or delete existing data. This tool runs independently and thus does not
require Archiv-Editor to be installed on the computer. Any computer with
internet access is sufficient, it is only necessary to be able to log in with an
Admin-account (one must also register on the website before gaining access to
this tool). Click on the symbol that displays a person. A tree-view will then
appear, similar to that in the Archiv-Editor. The project can be selected from
this tree. Click on the small arrow to the left of the project name and a
list of all the users registered with this project will appear. At the very
top of the list is the option “New User”, click on this to create a new
account. A form will open to the right of the tree requesting a username and
password. Additional data such as contact information can be entered if
wished.
</p>

        <p class="p" id="x23-450008.2.2__idp196728">If a user should be edited that already exists in the tree, simply click on their
name and a form will open up with their information. To log out, click the red
icon picturing a power button. This is found in the small icon list at the top of
the window.
