  <div class="body">
    <p class="p" id="x3-20001__idp1205576">The Archiv-Editor is a program to compile and organize biographical information.
It supports the typical work-flow of a historical research project. For this reason
data regarding persons as well as their corresponding references are documented.
The Archiv-Editor allows multiple users to work on the same data inventory;
information is saved temporarily on a local database and then regularly updated
to the repository.
</p>

    <p class="p" id="x3-20001__idp232544">The first version of the program was created at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy
of Sciences through the initiative Telota. The project “Preussen als Kulturstaat”
used the Archiv-Editor to collect and structure biographical information.
The DFG project “Personendaten-Repositorium” (PDR) developed a
software-architecture based on this experience, which would allow multiple
projects to store their biographical data in one repository. The Archiv-Editor is
an essential part of this architecture.
</p>

    <p class="p" id="x3-20001__idp233600">A special characteristic of the PDR data model is its ability to assimilate different
kinds of data. A person is made up of an arbitrary number of descriptions. A
single description refers to an event, a quality, or a fact within a specific
context. The biography of a person is a result of the summation of these
descriptions. The content of a description is completely open: it can consist of
names, institutions, places, dates, time frames, terms, and can be of any
length.
</p>

    <p class="p" id="x3-20001__idp234568">These biographical descriptions usually come from references in original texts. To
avoid a standardization of the varying orthographies found in such texts, projects
can create their own systematic vocabulary. This shared vocabulary allows for a
semantic summary of the biographical descriptions and functions as a standard
without sacrificing original orthography.
</p>

    <p class="p" id="x3-20001__idp235408">The Archiv-Editor offers innovative tools to create a project vocabulary, to enter
and process biographical descriptions and to organize persons. In addition,
through a cooperation with the ANR-DFG Project Musici, localisations in both
French and Italian are also available.
